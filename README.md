# Custom Memory Allocator

A custom memory allocator implementation in C, created to explore low-level systems programming concepts.

## Features
- Fixed-size heap initialization (1 MB).
- `BlockHeader` structure for memory management.
- Basic `malloc` and `free` interface (in progress).

## Build and Run
Use the Makefile to build the demo:
```bash
make
./allocator_demo
```
